== External services ==

This plugin integrates with the following third-party services:

### Google reCAPTCHA

- **What the service is and what it is used for**:  
  Google reCAPTCHA is used to protect the WordPress login form from automated bot attacks. It helps to ensure that only human users can attempt to log in.

- **What data is sent and when**:  
  The plugin sends a reCAPTCHA verification token to Google's API whenever a login attempt is made (if reCAPTCHA is enabled). This token is used to validate that the login attempt is from a human user.

- **Links to the service's terms of service and privacy policy**:  
  - Terms of Service: [https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html)
  - Privacy Policy: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

### How reCAPTCHA works in this plugin:

- **On Login Form**: When a user attempts to log in, if the reCAPTCHA is enabled, the plugin will send a request to Google's reCAPTCHA API to verify if the submitted token is valid.
- **On Failed Login Attempts**: In case of repeated failed login attempts, the plugin may block the IP or username temporarily, as part of the brute-force protection. The reCAPTCHA check ensures that only valid users (humans) can proceed to the login page.
- **What data is sent**: The plugin sends the user's IP address and the reCAPTCHA verification token (if applicable) to Google for validation.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I enable reCAPTCHA on my login page? =

1. Navigate to the plugin settings under "Settings" > "Themehunk Login Registration Security".
